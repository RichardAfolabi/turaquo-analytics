US Telecoms Network Infrastructure Analytics
==============

Project Introduction
=====

Despite some 20 years of research efforts that have focused on understanding aspects of the Internetâ€™s infrastructure such as its router-level topology, very little is known about its individual components such as cell towers, routers or switches, and fiber-optic cables which are concrete entities with well-defined geographic locations.

This data set provides a first-of-its-kind map of the US long haul fiber infrastructure. The details of the connectivity and shared use of conduits has been verified using public records on rights-of-way. The dataset is made available through PREDICT and includes the image of the map as well as a table that provides all details on connectivity represented in the map. https://www.predict.org/

* <b>20 Service Providers:</b> <em>(Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Tata, CenturyLink, Cogent, etc)</em>
* <b>273 Nodes:</b> <em>(Routers, Switches, cell-towers/Base stations, etc)</em>
* <b>542 Fiber nodes:</b> <em>(Edges connecting the nodes)</em>
